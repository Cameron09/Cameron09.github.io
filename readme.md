# What I do
Hi, I'm Cameron Petkov and I am an electrical engineering and computer science student studying at Curtin University. I plan to use this space to upload university projects and side projects that I have created.

# Disclaimer
While university projects have been uploaded after the semester the work was produced in is officially over and/or with the consent of the unit coordinators, I accept no responsibility if the university creates a similar assessment and my work happens to significantly assist in solving the assessment. If any future student/s decide to use my work without properly citing it, I will not be responsible for any academic penalty that the university may apply.
